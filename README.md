# TuneSort

## Description

Discover algorithms musically with TuneSort. It transforms sorting steps into harmonious tunes, making learning algorithms engaging and intuitive.

## Features

- **Algorithm Visualisation**: See how different sorting algorithms organize data in real-time.
- **Musical Interpretation**: Each step of the sort is translated into a musical note, creating a melody as the algorithm works through the data.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the speed of sorting, allowing for a detailed understanding of each step or a quicker overview.
- **Shuffle and Sort**: Users can shuffle the dataset and watch as it gets sorted back into order, providing an interactive learning experience.
- **Start/Stop Functionality**: Gives users control over the sorting process, allowing them to start or pause the sorting at any time.

## How to Use

1. **Starting the Application**: Open the application in your browser to see the default visualisation setup.
2. **Shuffling Data**: Click the 'Shuffle' button to randomise the data set.
3. **Adjusting Speed**: Use the provided slider to adjust the sorting speed to your preference.
4. **Sorting Data**: Click the 'Play' button to start the sorting algorithm. You'll hear the corresponding notes as each item is sorted.
5. **Pausing the Sort**: Click the 'Stop' button at any time to pause the sorting process.

## Future Improvements

- **Additional Sorting Algorithms**: Expand the range with more sorting algorithms for varied visual and auditory experiences.

- **Diverse Musical Scales**: Introduce a variety of musical scales, enriching the auditory experience of each sorting process.

- **Enhanced Algorithm Statistics**: Offer in-depth statistics like time complexity for each algorithm, providing more educational insights.

- **Customisable Sound Options**: Allow customisation of sounds for different sorting actions, enhancing user engagement.

- **Jazz Mode**: Create a feature where algorithms can 'improvise' over jazz tracks for a unique blend of sorting and musical creativity.

- **Sorting Completion Indicator**: Implement visual and auditory cues to indicate the completion of sorting, like a green sweep through the sorted data.

- **Live Key Changes**: Enable live key changes during sorting for a dynamic, involved musical experience.
